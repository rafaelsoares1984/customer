# Tools used for develop application

   - **Spring Boot**
        
        Spring boot was used, because it is easier to group the infrastructures configurations more easily
   - **Maven**
        
        Maven is an excellent package manager, as being the standard of the spring boot
   - **Apache Tomcat**
        
        Apache Tomcat as being the standard for the spring boot, was used
   - **H2 Database**
        
        Since no instructions on database usage were provided, we chose to use H2 Database, which does not require installation, as well as being portable
   - **Gitlab**
        
        Easier to use, I'm already used to it
